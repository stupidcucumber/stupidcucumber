# Hi.
I want to be an Artificial Intelligence Engineer with great knowledge of math (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics theory, Differential Equations).

I know Python (and its biggest libraries, such as numpy, pandas, tensorflow, pyTorch, keras, matplotlib, opencv, scikit-learn) and a little bit of Java, C++ and Go. I also love football and enjoy listening to music!
